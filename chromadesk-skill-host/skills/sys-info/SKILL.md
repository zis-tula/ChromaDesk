# sys-info

Query system health and running processes on a remote host connected through ChromaDesk.

## Tools

### get_system_info

Retrieve OS version, CPU model and usage, memory and swap totals/used, disk usage, hostname, and uptime. Takes no parameters.

Returns:

```json
{
  "os": "Ubuntu 22.04",
  "kernel": "5.15.0",
  "hostname": "prod-server-01",
  "cpu": { "model": "AMD EPYC 7763", "cores": 8, "usage_percent": "12.3" },
  "memory": { "total_mb": 16384, "used_mb": 8200, "usage_percent": "50.0" },
  "swap": { "total_mb": 4096, "used_mb": 128 },
  "disks": [{ "mount": "/", "total_gb": 500.0, "available_gb": 320.5, "fs": "ext4" }],
  "uptime": "14h 32m"
}
```

### list_processes

List running processes with resource usage, sorted and limited.

- **sort_by** (string, optional) — sort by `"cpu"`, `"memory"`, or `"name"` (default: `"cpu"`)
- **limit** (integer, optional) — max number of processes to return (default: 50)

Returns:

```json
{
  "total_processes": 312,
  "showing": 5,
  "sort_by": "cpu",
  "processes": [
    { "pid": 1234, "name": "node", "cpu_percent": "45.2", "memory_mb": 512 }
  ]
}
```

## Workflow

1. Call `get_system_info` to get an overview of the remote machine's health.
2. If CPU or memory usage is high, call `list_processes` sorted by `"cpu"` or `"memory"` to identify the top consumers.
3. Use `limit` to control result size when only the top offenders are needed.
