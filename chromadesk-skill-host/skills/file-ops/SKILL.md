# file-ops

Manage files and directories on a remote host connected through ChromaDesk.

## Tools

### read_file

Read the text contents of a file.

- **path** (string, required) — absolute path to the file

Returns `{ "path", "content", "size" }`.

### write_file

Write content to a file. Creates the file (and parent directories) if it does not exist; overwrites if it does.

- **path** (string, required) — absolute path to the file
- **content** (string, required) — content to write

Returns `{ "path", "bytes_written" }`.

### list_directory

List files and directories at a given path, sorted directories-first then alphabetically.

- **path** (string, required) — absolute path to the directory

Returns `{ "path", "count", "entries": [{ "name", "type", "size" }] }`.

### create_directory

Create a directory and any missing parent directories.

- **path** (string, required) — absolute path of the directory to create

Returns `{ "path", "created": true }`.

### move_file

Move or rename a file or directory.

- **source** (string, required) — source path
- **destination** (string, required) — destination path

Returns `{ "source", "destination", "moved": true }`.

### get_file_info

Get file metadata including size, type, modification time, and permissions.

- **path** (string, required) — absolute path to the file or directory

Returns `{ "path", "type", "size", "readonly", "modified_unix", "permissions_octal" }` (permissions_octal on Unix only).

## Workflow

1. Use `list_directory` to browse a remote folder.
2. Use `read_file` to inspect a specific file.
3. Use `write_file` to create or update content — parent directories are created automatically.
4. Use `get_file_info` before destructive operations like `move_file` to confirm the target exists and check permissions.
