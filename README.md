ChromaDesk is the **first AI-native remote desktop** — an open-source, free application with a **built-in MCP (Model Context Protocol) Server** that lets any AI agent see and control remote computers.

While other remote desktop tools only serve human users, ChromaDesk extends **AI Computer Use** from "local machine only" to **"any remote machine in the world"**. Connect Claude, GPT, Cursor, or any MCP-compatible AI to ChromaDesk, and it can screenshot, click, type, drag, and automate across remote desktops — just like a human operator, but faster and 24/7.

Built on Google Chromium Remoting technology (the engine behind Chrome Remote Desktop), ChromaDesk delivers industrial-grade performance, stability, and security refined over 10+ years by Google.

## Why ChromaDesk?

### AI-First: The Only Remote Desktop with MCP Support  [ → MCP Integration Guide](docs/mcp-integration.md)

- **Built-in MCP Server**: AI agents connect via standard MCP protocol — no plugins, no hacks, zero configuration
- **Dual Transport**: stdio mode (AI client spawns process) or HTTP/SSE mode (ChromaDesk hosts MCP server for multi-client access)
- **Full Computer Use Toolkit**: 20+ MCP tools — screenshot, click, type, drag, scroll, hotkeys, clipboard, and more
- **Real-Time Visibility**: AI operations are displayed in the ChromaDesk GUI in real time — the user sees every mouse move and keystroke, and can intervene at any time
- **Multi-Device AI Orchestration**: AI can connect to and control multiple remote machines simultaneously — batch automation, cross-device workflows, fleet management
- **Guided Prompts**: 9 built-in MCP prompt templates covering remote operation, server health check, batch automation, system diagnosis, screen analysis, multi-device orchestration, and SOP documentation

### High-Performance Foundation

- **Open-Source & Free**: MIT License, no feature restrictions, no connection limits, commercial use welcome
- **Self-Hosted**: Deploy your own signaling and TURN relay servers, keep full control of your data
- **Commercial-Grade Foundation**: Built on Chromium Remoting — the same technology powering Chrome Remote Desktop, refined by Google for 10+ years and proven by billions of users
- **Pure C++ Ultimate Performance**: Full C++ stack from protocol core to GUI — no GC pauses, no runtime overhead, minimal memory and CPU footprint
- **Modern Codecs**: H.264, VP8, VP9, AV1 — flexibly switch based on network and hardware conditions
- **WebRTC P2P Direct Connection**: Prioritizes peer-to-peer connections for lowest latency; automatically falls back to TURN relay when traversal fails
- **Cross-Platform**: Windows and macOS supported (Linux planned)
- **Modern UI**: Fluent Design interface built with Qt 6 + QML, with light and dark themes

### Why Best-in-Class Performance?

1. **Pure C++ Full Stack**: The entire stack — from low-level protocol to GUI — is implemented in C++. No garbage collection pauses, no VM/runtime overhead. Compared to RustDesk's Dart/Flutter GUI layer or ToDesk's Electron-based approach, CPU and memory usage are significantly lower.

2. **Chromium-Level Optimization**: Core paths for video encoding/decoding, network transmission, and screen capture directly reuse Chromium's highly optimized C++ code, including SIMD instruction optimization and zero-copy rendering pipelines.

3. **Shared Memory Video Transfer**: ChromaDesk uses shared memory to pass video frames (YUV I420) between processes, eliminating the serialization/deserialization and data copying overhead of traditional IPC.

4. **GPU-Accelerated Rendering**: YUV data is fed directly into the GPU rendering pipeline via Qt 6's `QVideoSink`, achieving zero-CPU-copy video rendering.

## Features

### AI Integration (MCP Server)
- Built-in MCP Server — AI agents connect via standard protocol, works with Cursor, Claude Desktop, VS Code, and any MCP client
- Dual transport: stdio (AI client launches process) or HTTP/SSE (ChromaDesk manages MCP server, multiple AI clients connect)
- Persistent MCP transport mode — remembers your stdio/HTTP choice across restarts
- 40+ MCP tools: screenshot, mouse click/drag/scroll, keyboard type/hotkey, clipboard, OCR text recognition, UI element detection, screen verification, and more
- Host-side skill host with built-in skills (system info, file operations, shell execution) — run structured tools on the remote machine
- Pluggable skills architecture — add custom skill directories, skills auto-load and sync to connected clients
- Skill host toggle in Settings — enable/disable the skill host process with persistent configuration
- MCP Resources: real-time device status, connection info, host details
- 9 MCP Prompts: operation guide, server health check, batch automation, system diagnosis, screen analysis, multi-device orchestration, SOP documentation
- Real-time event streaming: connection state changes, clipboard updates, screen changes, performance stats
- Event-driven tools: wait_for_event, wait_for_connection_state, wait_for_clipboard_change, wait_for_screen_change for reactive automation

## Getting Started

### Download

Go to [Releases](https://github.com/barry-ran/ChromaDesk/releases) to download the latest version:

| Platform | Download |
|----------|----------|
| Windows x64 | [ChromaDesk-win-x64-setup.exe](https://github.com/barry-ran/ChromaDesk/releases/latest) |
| macOS ARM64 | [ChromaDesk-mac-arm64.dmg](https://github.com/barry-ran/ChromaDesk/releases/latest) |

### Usage

1. Install and run ChromaDesk on both the **host** (remote) and **client** (local) machines
2. The host will automatically generate a **Device ID** and **Access Code**
3. On the client, enter the host's Device ID and Access Code, then click **Connect**
4. You're now remotely controlling the host machine

### Silent install (Windows installer)

The Windows package is built with **Inno Setup** (`scripts/installer/chromadesk.iss`). Standard Inno command-line switches apply:

| Switch | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| `/SILENT` | No wizard pages; progress window may appear |
| `/VERYSILENT` | Fully unattended (no progress window) |
| `/DIR="path"` | Install directory (optional) |
| `/TASKS="..."` | Comma-separated tasks from `[Tasks]` |

Available tasks:

| Task | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `desktopicon` | Create desktop shortcut |
| `startmenuicon` | Create Start Menu shortcut |
| `vdd` | Install virtual display driver (IDD) and related files, required for virtual display feature |

All three tasks are selected by default (`Flags: checkedonce` — checked on first install, preserves user choice on upgrades). To skip the virtual display driver, explicitly exclude `vdd` via `/TASKS`.

Examples:

```bat
REM Default tasks (includes virtual display driver when selected in script defaults)
ChromaDesk-win-x64-setup.exe /VERYSILENT

REM Explicit tasks
ChromaDesk-win-x64-setup.exe /VERYSILENT /TASKS="desktopicon,startmenuicon,vdd"

REM Install without virtual display driver
ChromaDesk-win-x64-setup.exe /VERYSILENT /TASKS="desktopicon,startmenuicon"

REM Custom install path
ChromaDesk-win-x64-setup.exe /VERYSILENT /DIR="D:\ChromaDesk"
```

After a silent install, **ChromaDesk.exe is not auto-launched** (`skipifsilent` in the installer script), but the **ChromaDeskHost** Windows service is still installed and started when configured in `[Run]`.

Administrator rights are required (`PrivilegesRequired=admin` in the script).

## Build from Source

### Requirements

- CMake 3.19+
- Qt 6.5+ (Multimedia and WebSockets modules required)
- C++17 compiler

### Windows

```bash
# Requires Visual Studio 2022 + MSVC
# Set Qt path environment variable
set ENV_QT_PATH=C:\Qt\6.8.3

# Build
scripts\build_qd_win.bat Release

# Package (requires Inno Setup)
scripts\publish_qd_win.bat Release
scripts\package_qd_win.bat Release
```

### macOS

```bash
# Requires Xcode Command Line Tools
# Set Qt path environment variable
export ENV_QT_PATH=/path/to/Qt/6.8.3

# Build
bash scripts/build_qd_mac.sh Release

# Package
bash scripts/publish_qd_mac.sh Release
bash scripts/package_qd_mac.sh Release
```

### API Key (Optional)

If you deploy your own signaling server with API Key enabled, there are two ways to configure the API Key:

**Method 1: Runtime Configuration (Recommended)**

In ChromaDesk **Settings → Network → API Key**, enter your signaling server's API Key. This is the recommended approach — no recompilation needed, and each deployment can use its own key.

**Method 2: Build-time Injection**

You can also inject the API Key at build time as a compile-time default:

```bash
# Windows
set ENV_CHROMADESK_API_KEY=your-secret-key
scripts\build_qd_win.bat Release

# macOS
ENV_CHROMADESK_API_KEY=your-secret-key bash scripts/build_qd_mac.sh Release
```

> **Priority**: Runtime API Key (from Settings) takes precedence over the build-time key. If both are set, the runtime value is used.

Without either configuration, the client can only connect to signaling servers without API Key protection.

> **WebClient note:** The WebClient is a static web page running in the browser. Since API keys embedded in JavaScript are visible via DevTools, the WebClient uses **Origin whitelist** validation instead of API Key. Configure `ALLOWED_ORIGINS` on the signaling server to restrict which domains can access it. Browsers automatically send the `Origin` header and JavaScript cannot forge it, so only the WebClient served from your official domain will be allowed.

See [Signaling Server Deployment](docs/signaling-server-deployment.md) for details.

## Self-Hosted Deployment

ChromaDesk supports full self-hosted deployment. You can deploy all services on your own servers to ensure data security.

### Components

1. **Signaling Server** (required): Handles device registration and signaling relay
   → [Signaling Server Deployment Guide](docs/signaling-server-deployment.md)
2. **TURN Relay Server** (recommended): Provides relay when P2P direct connection fails
   → [TURN Server Deployment Guide](docs/turn-server-deployment.md)

### Docker Deploy (Signaling Server)

Three deployment methods for the signaling server:

```bash
cd SignalingServer
cp .env.example .env && vim .env

# Option 1: Pull pre-built image (recommended)
./deploy-pull.sh

# Option 2: Build from source
./deploy-build.sh

# Option 3: Offline deploy (no internet needed)
./deploy-offline.sh chromadesk-signaling-image.tar.gz
```

Pre-built Docker images are automatically published to `ghcr.io/barry-ran/chromadesk-signaling` on each tagged release. See the [deployment guide](docs/signaling-server-deployment.md) for details.

### Client Configuration

In ChromaDesk **Settings → Network**:
- Signaling server address: `ws://your-server.com:8000` or `wss://your-server.com:8000`
- API Key: Enter the API Key configured on your signaling server (if enabled)
- Custom STUN server: `stun:your-server.com:3478`
- Custom TURN server: `turn:your-server.com:3478` (username and password required)
